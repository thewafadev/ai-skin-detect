# Cloud-Based AI System for Skin Disease Detection and Classification

## Overview
This project leverages deep learning and cloud technologies to detect and classify skin diseases from dermoscopic images.  
The goal is to build an accessible, scalable, and accurate system that can assist dermatologists and improve early diagnosis of skin conditions.
## Motivation
Skin cancer and related diseases are among the most common health issues worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. However, access to dermatologists can be limited, especially in remote areas. By combining deep learning with cloud deployment, this project aims to create a tool that can support medical professionals and increase accessibility for patients globally.

## Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras for model development  
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, Pillow  
- **Web Deployment**: Flask/Streamlit for app interface  
- **Cloud Integration**: Firebase/Cloud DB for storage and scalability
